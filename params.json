{"name":"insuree","tagline":"Simulate mortality using actuarial life table","body":"### Problem\r\nActuaries use mortality tables, such as the one available [here](http://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html), to estimate the probability an individual will die at certain future times.  Using a mortality table, it is pretty straight forward to calculate the probability that an individual will die at a specific future time.  For example let's say we have the following mortality table:\r\n\r\n| x | q_x |\r\n| :---: | :---: |\r\n| 0 | 0.08 |\r\n| 1 | 0.04 |\r\n| 2 | 0.03 |\r\n\r\nAs is standard in actuarial mortality tables, each integer in the x column represents the individual at her x birthday.  The q_x column provides the probability that she will die between birthday x and birthday x + 1. (e.g. at her 1st birthday she has a 0.04 probability of dying before her 2nd birthday and a (1.0 - 0.04)*(0.03) = 0.0282 probability of dying between her second and 3rd birthdays).  \r\n\r\nBut, when we add more and more individuals to the mix, the calculation can become messy quickly.  Also we may want to use different mortality tables to represent each individual.  To further complicate things, we may provide different insurance benefits to each individual depending on his or her specific policy terms.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\nThe `insuree` package defines a class, `Insuree`, that represents an `Insuree` by a mortality table, an age, some kind of insurance policy terms, and projected future interest rates.  Using these attributes, we can simulate the present value of the individuals life contingent benefits.  The benefits can be death benefits or life contingent annuities.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
